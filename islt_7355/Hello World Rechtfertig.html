    <body>Hi I’m Andrea Rechtfertig. The simplest way I can describe myself is shy on the streets, but a freak on the sheets. Although I appear reserved and a little hesitant, I am still full of curious energy and creativity. I am a teacher by trade and passion but always a student at heart! I cannot say that I am not anxious about learning web design, but I also am very excited! I currently live and work in a small town in Missouri. I enjoy life in the country here in the beautiful country with friendly folks.  I like to sing in acapella groups with my chruch, and I love to to also get together with friends to play violin, ukulele, and the piano, and to drink coffee. I enjoy taking road trips with my teen son to spend time with family where we can spend summer days next to a large body of water. I respect artisans, so I like to also dabble in a little pottery, sewing, and Amigurami crochet, which I don't usually have time for. I enjoy many things, but there is much to learn and little time to learn it! Ciao, now I am going to go find some chocolate!

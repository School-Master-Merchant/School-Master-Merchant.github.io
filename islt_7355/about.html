<!-- Comment Section for Coding Buddies

    Greetings coding buddies! I cannot believe we are finishing up with week 2 already! 

I am a music teacher, and I have used plenty of software experience, but I have never coded before. I am excited to finally learn real tech skills, which I plan to use as a future instructional or curriculum design careers. <br/>When I am not learning, I enjoy functional art that is useful (e.g., pottery, crochet etc.) Can I include web design as a functional art? When I am not working, I love to take road trips with my teen son. We usually travel to a different state each year to visit with family and friends and to sight see new places.

   <div class="Content">
<p>I have been working as a teacher for over a <strong>decade</strong>. For the past three years, I have been teaching k-5th grade elementary music. I also support the English as a second language students for all the grades k-12! It is a small community, so I only have a few ESL students. I used to also teach Spanish and Latin. As a teacher during these past few years, I have realized how technology has impacted every industry; <em>including education</em>. Currently, teacher lesson plans are now accessible <em>online,</em> and for a moment in time, teachers had to learn how to create lessons that were digitally accessed. The type of instructional design that I have prepared is from what I have created in my own classroom or for my TPT store. I believe my foundation and experience in teaching will be advantageous as an instructional designer, but I know I have a lot to learn! <br>As a graduate student in the Learning Technologies and Design program, I am hoping to learn skills that go beyond subject matter & instructional-pedagogy procedures, so that I can learn the technology necessary in our current times. I also like the idea of the lateral mobility for instructional designers that give opportunities to work for schools, universities, or business-industries.</p>
<h3>My Teaching Creed</h3>
<blockquote>The purpose of education is to reinforce lifelong habits to think: critically, creatively, and ethically in order to create reliable and capable individuals who appreciate and value one another above themselves with genuine commitment toward the ultimate benefit of mankind. -Andrea Rechtfertig</blockquote>

    Hello, I am Andrea Rechtfertig. I am a teacher by trade but always a student at heart. I currently teach elementary music to k-5 as well as English as a second language. In my music class, I enjoy teaching: acapella singing, ukulele and the recorder. I enjoy bringing our the potential in my students. I play the piano, and during my undergraduate degree, I enjoyed playing the violin in the university orchestra. My major in college was in Spanish and ESL with a music emphasis. I once taught English as a second language overseas in a small but exotic country called Azerbaijan for one year where I learned to speak a little Turkish. I live in Missouri, and I am currently enrolled as a graduate student in the Learning Technologies and Design program. A few of my hobbies include: raod trips, gardening and cooking and reading. I also enjoy experimenting with functional art, such as pottery and Japanese Amigurumi Crocehting. A favorite past time is having friends over to discuss books and ideas while drinking coffee. I enjoy many things but there is much to learn and little time to learn it! Ciao, now I am going to go have some coffee.

<h1>Welcome to School-Master-Merchant</h1>
<h3>Certified teacher & Instructional Designer</h3>
<p> I am Andrea Rechtfertig and I am an experienced teacher and digital content creator. Don<span>&#39;</span>t waste your precious time building learning resources for your online empire when an experienced designer can do it for you. Having an online portfolio is a great first impression where I hope to showcase my creativity and competencies in education and instructional design. In my digital portfolio, I hope to present an engaging reflection of who I am as a person and as a professional. Two of the most important skills today include soft skills and digital skills. As a teacher of ten years, I have had to develop my soft skills in time management and problem solving like an algorithm on a search engine! Likewise, my digital skills in digit skills within the department of Learning Technologies and Design and the University of Missouri, continuing to improve. At last, with a digital portfolio, I am excited to be able to demonstrate the progression of my skills in interactive e-learning content for all to view.</p>

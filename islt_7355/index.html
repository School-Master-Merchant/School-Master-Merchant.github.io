<h1>Welcome to School-Master-Merchant</h1>

<p>The inspiration for the name of my website came from an ancient novel that was discovered in the 16th century by a Hungarian merchant. The novel revealed an island paradise where an Amazonian queen, called Queen Califia, ruled. This story ignited the great quest by the conquistadores who believed they might find a nation of riches and beautiful women.</p> 
    
    <h3>Certified teacher & Instructional Designer</h3>
    <p>Hello, I am Andrea Rechtfertig and I am an experienced teacher and digital content creator. If you are on a quest to conquer and showcase your operations and ideas to the rest of the world, then like the Hungarian merchant, I am here to help reveal those ideas through proficient design and technology. As an instructor of over ten years, I help fill in knowledge gaps by training others to learn a skill through task-based lessons, games, tutorials, or articles.  Businesses and schools today are increasingly realizing the essentials of an online presence with accessible training materials, and I am here to help reach a wider audience. With this website, I hope to be able to use it as a continual project to showcase my creativities and competencies in education and instructional design. In my digital portfolio, I hope to present an engaging reflection of who I am as a person and as a professional. Two of the most important skills today include soft skills and digital skills. As a teacher of ten years, I have had to develop my soft skills in time management and problem solving like an algorithm on a search engine! Likewise, my digital skills within the department of Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri, continue to improve. At last, with a digital portfolio, I am excited to be able to demonstrate the progression of my skills in interactive e-learning content for all to view.</p>

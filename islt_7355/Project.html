<br>Link to the interactive Spanish Lesson: file:///C:/Users/Arectfertig/Desktop/Website%20Panning/SpanishSerEstarAnInteractiveLessonwithworksheets-1.pdf
<br>I used a systematic fashion that began with explicit instruction in verb conjugation to language rules and applications. After the first two grammar pages, then engaging pictures follow, which are supposed to elicit either whole class or small group responses
 It is necessary for this page to have a teacher to explain how the two to-be verbs (ser and estar) elicits multiple meanings depending on the chose verb. 

Then an interactive exercise page, follows that allows one to click to reveal the answer. After two more practice with authentic language and applications, then it follows with expressions, and an interactive clickable page. It ends with a test/homework page that allows the student to practice; this page is a great analysis that will reveal how much has been learned. What did you learn, how would you do it differently now? I learned a lot about a functioning power point game, and how to upload it in a secure manner to my TPT store. Even though the lesson offers a lesson in a sequential manner, it still depends on a teacher to lead the lesson. I think I could offer an answer sheet or an example sheet with instructions for the teacher too. what materials did you use? All on Power Point, I created a test with an answer page, multiple pages for students to respond and create their own answers, two interactive exercises, and two grammar pages. 

2) Music Interactive Game: “Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader-Music”
This animated PowerPoint includes 34 slides with 31 rounds of questions about music. All of the answers are included too! This is a great game to play at the end of the year. This game is made for all of my k-5th grader music students. Pick a student to host and read the questions or host the game yourself! HAVE FUN! Kids can compete in teams, one-at-a-time or with a partner.

(what are strengths and weaknesses. The slides began in 1st grade and then moved up into 5th grade, and the slides in the early grades offered multiple choices, and I almost think multiple choice should have been included in every page since this was a lot of music terminology to remember. Also, if the younger students advanced into a higher grade, then they were not able to answer the questions unless they were given options. Nevertheless, the students loved playing and competing with one another. I played music from the Show to offer more of an authentic experience, but I would like to improve it by adding music to the intro and to the end. Also, a timer countdown that plays the music for each slide would have also been great.  what did you learn? I learned how to embed some sound and videos into parts of each slide. How would you do it differently now? Perhaps there will be a set of slides to accompany the game to help students first review their music material from over the school year, or maybe just a study guide with which lessons and terms that need to be reviewed. What materials did you use? I used Power point, Youtube, and youtube to mp3 converting software. I used lots of images, as well as animation and transitions. 

3) Group Reading Lesson for English as a second language Speakers: 
This is a task-based lesson initially built for intermediate to advanced ESL students, but it can be used for both native English speakers too. The pedagogical approach uses authentic language in a contextualized manner by applying pre-learned vocabulary in an every-day situation. The goal for the reading groups is to reach a communicative goal of open dialogue and authentic language.

Teaching Duration: 60 min.
What are strengths and weaknesses? I strived to create a lesson that would represent the linguistic competence of successful reading lesson. I chose a method not because it is simply good or fun, but because it serves a specific purpose. I began the lesson with systematic schemata.                        
 
 The lesson was engaging and interactive, and the one conducting the lesson does not have to be an expert on the topic since it uses a script. One weakness to address is that there needs to be at least a facilitator to conduct the lesson, and I think it would be helpful to also write out the vocabulary to pre-teach. What did you learn, how would you do it differently now? There will always be potential improvements, but I think one obvious need is to include a follow up to assess student’s abilities. what materials did you use? I included one story, two worksheets, strips of sequencing dialogue for students to organize, a teacher script, a poster/picture of the protagonist of the story, a poster of a plot diagram, and a game. IN conclusion, I feel that I was able to demonstrate the ability to assimilate an appropriate hands-on reading activity for students to actively model their speaking and thought processes within a contextualized manner.

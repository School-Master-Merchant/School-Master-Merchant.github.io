<div class="header--sub-header"></div><h3>An integrated statement that includes my Teaching Philosophy and Personal Reflection </h3></div>
<div class="content">
<p><div-a>Pedagogical studies and teaching experience has given me an appropriate foundation in what an effective lesson entails. My three main teaching and instructional design goals are that: students learn from the material, enjoy the lesson, and develop an interest and appreciation for the topic. As an experienced teacher, I am aware of teacher standards and student needs, and I have the ability to place myself in the learner’s needs. When creating a lesson, I can look at a seemingly mundane lesson, and contextualize it to make it more meaningful and approachable for the learner. I hope that I can apply this ability when creating my digital content as an instructional designer.</div-a></p>
 
 <p>My role as a teacher is rooted in the belief that a teacher is not a task-master who stands up front to lecture while students sit passively. I believe the most effective teacher is the one who acts as a facilitator instead of a lecturer; they are not there neither to entertain nor to rule but rather to act as a guide. As a facilitator, I encourage: active participation, group activities, gap exercises, and authentic applications. When creating curriculum and other learning content, I can apply methods to create active learning.  I can creatively tailor a lesson for the needs and goals of the students, and I enjoy knowing that my lessons will lead the learner from one goal to the next.</p>
   
  <p>As a graduate student in the learning technologies and design department, I am interested in the many ways an instructional designer can implement goals in a lesson or a training module.   By understanding a hierarchy of learning in a learner, I am able to create a more approachable but industrious environment where students can neither be passive nor disengaged. They understand that my goal is not to entertain, but rather to help them learn. To be able to develop online courses and learning games as an instructional designer, I knew that I had to become proficient in e-learning. Before my decision to study Learning Technologies and Design at the University of Missouri, I felt limited in my technical skills, and pigeon-holed into one career option. After reading about the duties of an instructional designer, I realized the possibilities of how my teaching experience could be transferable. I also realized that having to learn the technology needed to become a successful instructional designer will be challenging, but I also know that Mizzou is the place that will guide me to develop my technical skills in a world of emerging technology.</p>
  
  <p>Emerging technology is a necessary skill for those teaching a generation accustomed to using code hosting platforms, image and video editing software, and VR sets. The first step is to recognize that today, university students, no matter what their degree is, should also be trained to fulfill the technical of our modern world. Currently, I am very interested in the development of game design for learning, and I hope to gain skill in how to apply VR-enabled games for learning. I am specifically interested in being able to contribute to e-learning design for language acquisition as well as music, which are the subjects that I currently teach. I also desire to learn practical applications in things like project management and UX design. Within the learning design and technologies program, I am happy to be able to attain the essentials that will enable me to navigate the technical demands of instructional design.</p>
  
  <p>In the end, I believe that my training and experiences in teaching and some of my applications of technology in the classroom have prepared me as a teacher as well as an instructional designer. I am excited to achieve new skills in the Learning and Technologies Department at Mizzou that still relates to teaching but goes beyond: subject matter, instructional procedures, and theories in education. The lateral mobility for an instructional designer seem unmatched with opportunities in schools, universities, and/or in businesses. Mizzou’s list of technology in game design, VR-enabled instructional design, UX design, and e-portfolio offers the perfect plethora of academic rigor and career training that I have been looking for. I am eager to learn more about UX design especially since UX focuses on creating a user-friendly experience, which I believe is an intuitive skill that I have as a teacher who can empathize for the learner. Learning technology in the classroom is often time-consuming, but I have learned that the long-term benefits have overshadowed the initial discomfort. Likewise, I know that my dedication and effort in grad school will outweigh the final reward of achieving my dream in instructional design and technology. </p>

 <h1>Reflection / Teaching Philosophy</h1>

<h3>An integrated statement that includes my Teaching Philosophy and Personal Reflection </h3>

<p>Pedagogical studies and teaching experience has given me an appropriate foundation in what an effective lesson entails. My three main teaching and instructional design goals are that: students learn from the material, enjoy the lesson, and develop an interest and appreciation for the topic. As an experienced teacher, I am aware of teacher standards and student needs, and I have the ability to place myself in the learner’s needs. When creating a lesson, I can look at a seemingly mundane lesson, and contextualize it to make it more meaningful and approachable for the learner. I hope that I can apply this ability when creating my digital content as an instructional designer.</p>  

    <p>My role as a teacher is rooted in the belief that a teacher is not a task-master who stands up front to lecture while students sit passively. I believe the most effective teacher is the one who acts as a facilitator instead of a lecturer; they are not there neither to entertain nor to rule but rather to act as a guide. As a facilitator, I encourage: active participation, group activities, gap exercises, and authentic applications. When creating curriculum and other learning content, I can apply methods to create active learning.  I can creatively tailor a lesson for the needs and goals of the students, and I enjoy knowing that my lessons will lead the learner from one goal to the next. As a graduate student in the learning technologies and design department, I am interested in the many ways an instructional designer can implement goals in a lesson or a training module.   By understanding a hierarchy of learning in a learner, I am able to create a more approachable but industrious environment where students can neither be passive nor disengaged. They understand that my goal is not to entertain, but rather to help them learn.</p>

   <p>In the end, I believe that my training and experiences in teaching and some of my applications of technology in the classroom have prepared me as a teacher as well as an instructional designer. I am excited to learn new skills in the Learning and Technologies Department at Mizzou that still relates to teaching but goes beyond: subject matter, instructional procedures, and theories in education. The lateral mobility for an instructional designer seem unmatched with opportunities in schools, universities, and/or in businesses. Mizzou’s list of technology in game design, VR-enabled instructional design, UX design, and e-portfolio offers the perfect plethora of academic rigor and career training that I have been looking for. I am eager to learn more about UX design especially since UX focuses on creating a user-friendly experience, which I believe is an intuitive skill that I have as a teacher who can empathize for the learner. Learning technology in the classroom is often time-consuming, but I have learned that the long-term benefits have overshadowed the initial discomfort. Likewise, I know that my dedication and effort in grad school will outweigh the final reward of achieving my dream in instructional design and technology.</p>

    Hello, I am Andrea Rechtfertig. I am a teacher by trade but always a student at heart. I currently teach elementary music to k-5 as well as English as a second language. In my music class, I enjoy teaching: acapella singing, ukulele, and the recorder. I enjoy helping my students find their potential. I play the piano but I have had more training as a violinist. During my undergraduate studies, my major was Spanish and teaching English as a second language with a music emphasis, and I enjoyed playing my violin in the university orchestra. I once taught English as a second language overseas in a small but exotic country called Azerbaijan for one year where I learned a little bit of Turkish. I live in Missouri, and I am enrolled as a graduate student in the Learning Technologies and Design program. A few of my hobbies include: road trips, gardening, cooking, and reading. I also enjoy functional art like pottery and Japanese Amigurumi crocheting. A favorite past time is having friends over to discuss new ideas or books while sipping on a cozy cup of coffee. I enjoy many things, but there is much to learn and little time to learn it! Ciao, now I am going to go have some coffee.
